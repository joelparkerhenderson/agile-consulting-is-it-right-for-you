# Agile consulting: scorecard for first showcase

When you work with an agile consulting contractor or team, then I suggest weekly showcases. These are meetings where the agile consulting person shows the work in progress.

The purpose is to make decisions and surface new issues and make decisions. The purpose is never merely a status update or a readout report.

This page has agile consulting first showcase checklist that helps you decide if you're spending your time and money the best you can. This checklist can help you get better outcomes.

## Agile manifesto key points and checklist

**Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.**

- [ ] Is the showcase more on individuals and interactions and less on processes and tools?

  - Positive examples: external customers and their interactions. Great: their names and direct quotations about the immediate work. Good: their OKRs, KPIs, goals, metrics.

  - Negative examples: Internal processes and tools. Poor: Internal structures such as team layouts, silos, departments. Danger: internal people not interacting.

**Working software over comprehensive documentation.**

- [ ] Is the showcase more on working software and less on comprehensive documentation?

  - Positive examples: actual running software, even as a prototype or pilot or proof of value, even if it's small. Great: the software aims to be a thin slice. Good: the software aims to be a PoC.

  - Negative examples: focus primarily on documentation, such as presenting a PowerPoint deck, or reading a Word document, or showing a roadmap, or report, or review, or task list, or project planner.

**Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.**

- [ ] Is the showcase more on customer collaboration and less on contract negotiation?

  - Positive examples: Proof of customer collaboration. Great: at least one customer is in the showcase in person. Good: at least one customer is in the showcase via video.

  - Negative examples: Anything about contracts, such as rules, regulations, excuses such as not being able to talk to any customers.

**Responding to change over following a plan.**

- [ ] Is the showcase more on responding to change and less on following a plan?

  - Positive examples: Deliberately ask for three small things during the week's engagement, anything you like, and notice what happens in the showcase. For example I like to ask "Can you share previous work you've done so we can better-understand options?" and "What are some of the customer interaction approaches you favor?" and "Can you add the customer OKRs to the top of the first page?" Great: the agile consultant adapts in real time, and changes the work in real time during the showcase in front of the participants. Good: the agile consultant fields the question, and does it within 24 hours, and updates the stakeholders.

  - Negative examples: The consultant declines the changes, or says they're not needed, or says they need to stick to the plan, or says anything at all akin to "Trust us, we know what we're doing" without immediately providing evidence or reasoning.

## Agile principles key points and checklist

**Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer.**

- [ ] Does the showcase lead with a customer satisfaction metric?

  - Example: Net Promoter Score (NPS).

**Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.**

- [ ] Does the showcase welcome changing requirements?

  - Example: try asking for a relatively small relatively easy to understand change; how well did they handle the change request?

**Deliver working software frequently.**

- [ ] Does the showcase show working software?

  - Example: any kind of simple value proof, such as a production feature improvement, or even a prototype, pilot, or proof of value.

**Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.**

- [ ] Does the showcase include business people and developers at the showcase?

  - Example: this means the actual work team of business people and developers, and does not mean the agile consulting people, nor the executive sponsors, nor any engagement team, etc. (all of whom should be welcome at showcases, yet aren't the ones actually doing the customer-driven day-to-day work).

**Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.**

- [ ] Does the showcase identify motivated individuals and their trust?

  - Example: a specific person's name, their objectives, their resourcing, and how much they feel they're trusted to get the job done.

**The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a team is face-to-face conversation.**

- [ ] Does the showcase do face to face with actual customers?

  - Example: the customer is in the room, and so are the actual work team people-- at least one business person and at least one developer.

**Working software is the primary measure of progress.**

- [ ] Does the showcase demonstrate working software?

  - Example: a new feature, or even a pilot, or prototype, or proof of value. Even if the working software is simply a new web page, or new clickable UI, or new editable spreadhseet, that's an OK start for a first showcase.

**Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.**

- [ ] Does the showcase deal with sustainable development?

  - Example: addressing ongoing stakeholder engagement, or funding, or resourcing, or morale. Highlight any risks or issues here, such as churn of customers or teammates, low morale, higher-than-normal sick days, lack of resources, poor participation, and the like.

**Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.**

- [ ] Does the showcase deal with technical excellence and good design?

  - Example: touching on the customer value impact of technical excellence that improves agility and ability to change for the better, and good design that improves usability and ability for customers to generate value.

**Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.**

- [ ] Does the showcase deal with simplicity?

  - Example: any discussion of strategy and/or tactics and/or work must emphasize the choices to say no to suboptimal work, and also to constrain work in progress to one unit at a time.

**The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.**

- [ ] Does the showcase deal with emerging from self-organizing teams?

  - Example: any discussion of choices of architectures, requirements, and designs hones in on each team being able to make their own choices, including ways of working that are emergent. Good approaches can include active discussions about tradeoffs, good-enough versus perfection, buy versus build, and the like.
  
**At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.**

- [ ] Does the showcase deal with reflection?

  - Example: The reflection should be primarily about customer value, secondarily about internal work to improve the team. Ideally the showcase leaders highlight the agile engagement's reflection, such as a retrospective of the previous week.

## Score yourself

Add up your points above:

- 0-4 = Low. Terminate the consultant.

- 6-10 = Medium. Put the consultant on notice that the consulting needs signficant improvements, then have direct honest conversations about this checklist and what the consultant will do to improve by the next week's showcase.

- 11-16 = High. Your consultant is doing well, so proceed.

# Agile consulting: scorecard for hiring help

This page has a quick easy scorecard to help you figure out your agile readiness for hiring help. This scorecard can probably save you time and money.

- If you and all your teams can't yet answer these questions, then wait.

- When you and your teams do answer these questions, then use these in your hiring.

## Agile manifesto key points and checklist

**Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.**

- [ ] Every leader is in conversations with customers at least 1 hour per week.

  - Every leader means for every product, project, programme, practice, etc. 

  - Every week, radiate results to the whole group of stakeholders.

**Working software over comprehensive documentation.**

- [ ] Launch "hello world" to production. 

  - This means create an entirely new program, from scratch, and publish it.

  - Note what happens at each stage of the work and discuss it with the team.

**Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.**

- [ ] Have the organization buy one copies of the customer's favorite relevant book, and share with the team.

  - This creates collaborative communication and mutual understanding.

  - This simultaneously exercises the organization's ability to spend a small amount of money to help progress. Note that a teammate buying the book personally doesn't count-- this checklist is purposefully exercising the org as a whole.

**Responding to change over following a plan.**

- [ ] Each senior leader (BoD, CXO, VP, Dir) reads one agile change guide book, then shares the top 3 takeaways to the group.

  - This ensures senior leadership buy in, which is must-have for agile to succeed in the organization.

  - If a leader doesn't read a book and share, then figure out why before you hire a consultant.

## Agile principles key points and checklist

**Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer.**

- [ ] Every product lead measures customer net promoter score (NPS).

  - There are many ways to satisfy the customer, and many ways to measure this.

  - Start with NPS because it's quick, easy, widespread, and works well enough.

**Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.**

- [ ] Internationalize the "hello world" program from the above checklist item. 

  - This means upgrade the program to use at least one additional language, and the user's locale environment.

  - This tests how quickly the team can make a simple change that's easy to understand.

**Deliver working software frequently.**

- [ ] Launch the internationalization topic, as above, into production. 

  - Verify the translation is correct by asking the customer or a native speaker of the language.

  - This tests how quickly the team can launch an upgrade.

**Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.**

- [ ] Get commitment from every lead person for every product, project, programme, practice. 

  - This ensures full alignment and across-team commitment to shared ways of working.

  - If there are conflicts among the stakeholders, then sort these before hiring help.

**Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.**

- [ ] Pick a motivated individual and a customer to create a real new product MVP. 

  - Use the "3 amigos": one business person, one development person, and one testing person.

  - Deliver results to production within 30 days and on budget.

**The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a team is face-to-face conversation.**

- [ ] Get commitment from all product owners to have all staff face-to-face >50% time.

  - If your company has ways of working that are mostly remote, then pick one day a week for each team to video.

  - In my experience, all-in-person tends to be approximately +20% faster and also +20% higher quality.

**Working software is the primary measure of progress.**

- [ ] Create and ship a new program "fizz buzz" into production. 

  - This program is a simple one that prints some numbers and text.

  - There are plenty of free open source versions ready to use.

**Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.**

- [ ] Secure all staff sustaining budget +1 year; if not, why not? 

  - This checklist item detects the organization's capability for sustainable development.

  - This is because lack of sustainability is a frequent trouble spot for agile change.

**Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.**

- [ ] System quality attribute metrics in place in precommit hook and continuous integration services.

**Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.**

- [ ] Each product team has 2+ people who have process improvement skills.

  - Such as knowing one or more of Lean, Six Sigma, value stream mapping, total project control, TPS, or equivalent.

  - These tactics aren't agile per se; instead, they correlate highly with large organization agile readiness.  

**The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.**

- [ ] Measure by 5-point Likert scale "Our team is self-organizing". The results must average to "Agree" or better. 

  - If the results are lower, then work on self-organization practices before you spend money on agile consulting.

  - There are many ways to improve here; one that I recommend is The Vanguard Method.

**At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.**

- [ ] Each leader shares previous 2 reflections with all stakeholders.

  - A reflection is sometimes called a retrospective, or post-work report, etc.

  - In practice, many leaders skip reflection, which causes agile to fail.

## Score yourself

Add up your points above:

- 0-4 = Low. Don't do it because you're not ready enough. Instead, focus on internal operations, such as your choice of business process optimization, or value stream mapping, or lean development, or similar.

- 6-10 = Medium. Do your agile homework first, using the ideas below. Try some of the ideas and practices at your organization for at least 3 months, then retake this agile consulting readiness checklist to see your improvements.

- 11-16 = High. You're likely ready enough, so try it and see how it goes for 3 months or so.

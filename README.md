## Why use this page?

I provide agile consulting for companies, ranging from small startups to large enterprises, and ranging from one-on-one with a CTO to many-to-many with teams-of-teams.

- What I see in practice: many companies can save quite a lot of time, money, and morale by reading this one page, and using many of the excellent existing books or videos or course. Don't spend expensive resources on agile change consulting until you all know the basics.

- What I see in practice: agile change consulting only works when company leadership is all on board with trying agile change consulting. This means the CXOs and VPs must do their homework ahead of time. Don't embark on agile change until your leaders are all ready.

Read the basics which are all free:

## Do your homework

Broadly you'll get more for your time and money by having your staff do basic homework first.

- Homework can be as simple as each person reading one book about agile and one book about sector-specific change. Or watch one video about each, or take one online course about each, or any equivalent.

- I estimate that each 1 hour a teammate spends on homework before the engagement saves 1.5 person-hours during the engagement. Homework really pays off to do ahead of time.

Agile books:

- There are many books about agile, and you can choose any of them. I particularly like the [The Agile Samurai](https://pragprog.com/titles/jtrap/the-agile-samurai/).

- There are many books about sector-specific change, and you can choose any of them. For For healthcare, I particularly like [Transforming Health Care](https://www.amazon.com/Transforming-Health-Care-Virginia-Experience/dp/1563273756).

If you and your teams experience pushback about reading two books, or watching two videos, or taking two course, then ask yourself this-- do you really want to spend your time and money hiring agile change consulting, when your teams aren't ready to do basic homework?

Good agile change consulting looks like teams being ready, willing, and able to embark on new ways of collaborating with customers and end users, to move faster and to deliver better outcomes.

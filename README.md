# Agile change consulting - is it right for you?

I provide agile change consulting for companies, ranging from small startups to large enterprises, and ranging from one-on-one with a CTO to many-to-many with teams-of-teams.

- What I see in practice: many companies can save quite a lot of time, money, and morale by reading this one page, and using many of the excellent existing books or videos or course. Don't spend expensive resources on agile change consulting until you all know the basics.

- What I see in practice: agile change consulting only works when company leadership is all on board with trying agile change consulting. This means the CXOs and VPs must do their homework ahead of time. Don't embark on agile change until your leaders are all ready.

This page is a quick checklist to help you figure out your readiness level for engaging with agile change consulting providers. You can also share this page with your leaders and your teammates, so they can learn about a bit about the basics and what's involved.

- If you and all your teams can't yet answer these questions, then wait.

- When you and your teams do answer these questions, then use these in your hiring.

## Agile manifesto key points and checklist

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools:

- [ ] Every product lead summarizes 1-hour discussion with top-10 customer

Working software over comprehensive documentation:

- [ ] Launch "hello world" to production.

Customer collaboration over contract negotiation:

- [ ] Buy and read the customer's favorite relevant book, and get reimbursed

Responding to change over following a plan:

- [ ] All leadership (BoD, CXO, VP, Dir) reads one agile change guide book.

## Agile principles key points and checklist

Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer…

- [ ] Every product lead measures customer net promoter score (NPS).

Welcome changing requirements, even late in development…

- [ ] Internationalize "hello world" to use the UN languages and browser locale.

Deliver working software frequently…

- [ ] Launch the internationalized feature to production.

Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.

- [ ] Get commitment from all product owners to do this.

Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need,
and trust them to get the job done.

- [ ] Pick a customer to run a real new project + 3 amigos + 3 squad + 30 day budget.

The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a 
team is face-to-face conversation.

- [ ] Get commitment from all product owners to have all staff face-to-face >50%.

Working software is the primary measure of progress.

- [ ] Get lead time to change "fizz buzz" from 100 to 1000 in production.

Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

- [ ] Secure all staff sustaining budget +1 year; if not, why not?

Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

- [ ] System quality attribute metrics in place in precommit hook and CI

Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.

- [ ] Each product team has 2+ people who know Lean Six Sigma or VSM or equivalent.

The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

- [ ] Measure by 5-point Likert "Our team is self-organizing"; must average "Agree".

At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
its behavior accordingly.

- [ ] Product lead shares previous 2 reflections with customers, proves notes, actions, and outcomes.

## Score yourself

If you and your leaders and your teams weren't able to get through the checklist, then I suggest you're going to get more from your time and money by having your staff do basic homework first.

- Homework can be as simple as each person reading one book about agile and one book about sector-specific change. Or watch one video about each, or take one online course about each, or any equivalent.

Agile books:

- There are many books about agile, and you can choose any of them. I particularly like the [The Agile Samurai](https://pragprog.com/titles/jtrap/the-agile-samurai/).

- There are many books about sector-specific change, and you can choose any of them. For For healthcare, I particularly like [Transforming Health Care](https://www.amazon.com/Transforming-Health-Care-Virginia-Experience/dp/1563273756).

If you and your teams experience pushback about reading two books, or watching two videos, or taking two course, then ask yourself this-- do you really want to spend your time and money hiring agile change consulting, when your teams aren't ready to do basic homework?

Good agile change consulting looks like teams being ready, willing, and able to embark on new ways of collaborating with customers and end users, to move faster and to deliver better outcomes.
